# RubyFlix

RubyFlix is a proof of concept application for finding movies, adding movies to a watchlist and reviewing them.

RubyFlix is the final project for phase 3 of <a href="https://flatironschool.com/courses/coding-bootcamp/">Flatiron School's Software Engineering</a> bootcamp. This is the backend repo for the project, built with Ruby. The <a href="https://github.com/michael-neis/rubyflix-frontend">frontend</a> is in a seperate repo, built with React.js with custom CSS and styled components using the <a href="https://mui.com/">MUI library</a>.

To view the setup for this project and a brief walkthrough, please view the README in my <a href="https://github.com/michael-neis/rubyflix-frontend">frontend</a> repo.
